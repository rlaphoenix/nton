NTON is a Nintendo Switch NRO to NSP Forwarder for firmware 12.0.0 and newer.

A forwarder lets you open a Homebrew NRO file from your SD card through the Nintendo Switch Home Screen instead
of the Homebrew Launcher.

*Forwarders made with NTON.*

## Features

- üõ°Ô∏è Safety-first approach; System/Game Title IDs cannot be used and NRO files are validated
- üïπÔ∏è Boot right into an Emulated Game with Direct RetroArch Game Forwarding
- üñºÔ∏è Supports any Image file of any resolution or format for the NSP Icon
- ü§ñ The Title Name, Publisher, Icon, and more are automatically extracted from the NRO
- üé• Supports Video Capture and Screenshots
- ‚öô Currently Supports Firmware 12.0.0 and up
- üß© Plug-and-play installation via PIP/PyPI
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Forever FOSS!

## Installation

*Note: Requires [Python] 3.7.0 or newer with PIP installed.*

```shell
$ pip install nton
```

You now have the `nton` package installed and a `nton` executable is now available.
Check it out with `nton --help` - Voil√† üéâ!

*If you see any warnings about a path not being in your PATH environment variable, add it, or `nton` won't run.*

### Dependencies

The following is a list of programs required to be installed manually.  
I recommend installing these with [winget] or [chocolatey] where possible as it automatically adds them to your
`PATH` environment variable and will be easier to update in the future.

- [hacBrewPack] for packing the NSP.
- [ImageMagick] for Icon conversion and preparation.
- [nstool] for NRO extraction and verification.
- [hptnacp] for creating new NACP partitions if the NRO did not have one.

For portable downloads, make sure you put them in your current working directory, in the installation directory,
or put the directory path in your `PATH` environment variable. If you do not do this then NTON will not be able to
find any of the binaries.

### Keys

NTON requires the use of proprietary key data for use in various ways.

Place your `prod.keys` file at `C:\Users\<User>\.switch\prod.keys` or in your current working directory for
NTON to be able to find and use your keys.

Make sure your `prod.keys` file is up-to-date for the firmware version your Nintendo Switch is on. It can be extracted
from your Nintendo Switch with [Lockpick_RCM](https://github.com/shchmue/Lockpick_RCM).

### From Source Code

The following steps are instructions on downloading, preparing, and running the code under a Poetry environment.
You can skip steps 3-5 with a simple `pip install .` call instead, but you miss out on a wide array of benefits.

1. `git clone https://github.com/rlaphoenix/nton`
2. `cd nton`
3. (optional) `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true` 
4. `poetry install`
5. `poetry run nton --help`

As seen in Step 5, running the `nton` executable is somewhat different to a normal PIP installation.
See [Poetry's Docs] on various ways of making calls under the virtual-environment.

## Usage

Take a look at `nton --help`, specifically `nton build --help`.  
If you simply want to take an NRO and get an NSP forwarder, simply run `nton build "<nro path>"`.

Note that the NRO path MUST be on your Switch microSD card. Do not provide a path in your C:/ Drive or such.
Two different kinds of paths are used based on the initial file path, therefore it must be from your Switch microSD
card.

E.g., to make a forwarder for the Homebrew Menu that's on your Switch's microSD at `D:\hbmenu.nro`, simply run
`nton build "D:/hbmenu.nro"`

Take a look at `nton build --help` for advanced usage like changing the Icon, Title Name, and so on.

> __Warning__ Tinfoil corrupts the Installation of Forwarder NSPs for some reason, I recommend using DBI or Goldleaf.
See the Troubleshooting article "[The forwarder's icon is a loading circle, opening fails](#the-forwarders-icon-is-a-loading-circle-opening-fails)".

### Direct RetroArch Game forwarding

Use a RetroArch Game Core as the NRO path and provide the path to the ROM on your Switch's microSD card with `--rom`.  
This will then load the Core directly under RetroArch and provide the path to the ROM as a startup argument to the
RetroArch Core.

Note:

- You must use a path to a RetroArch Game Core NRO, not the path to the RetroArch NRO itself.
- Do not move, delete, or rename the ROM or the Core NRO files that are on your microSD card, or it will break.

## Troubleshooting

Before continuing try running the homebrew from the Homebrew Launcher and see if it works through there.
If it does not work through the Homebrew launcher either, then it was never the forwarder's fault and you should
check on your NRO or application installation.

Please note that using Forwarders others have created has a good chance of not working on your system.
The location of the NRO on their system may differ from the location on your system, hence the NSP won't be able
to load the homebrew.

### The forwarder does not launch, "The software was closed because an error occurred."

You're sigpatches that allow non-signed software to launch is outdated or not set up correctly.
The `prod.keys` you used to create the NSP may also be outdated. Get new ones with [Lockpick_RCM] and
make sure you choose to get keys from whichever SysNAND or EmuNAND is actually on the latest firmware.

### The forwarder starts loading but then crashes

If it gets to the black loading screen with the Nintendo Switch logo, but then crashes, you may be setting
the NRO path wrong when making the NSP. Make sure it starts with `/` and is an absolute path to an existing
NRO file on your Switch's microSD card. The path you built for must be where the NRO file lies in your Switch's
microSD card, not your PC.

### The forwarder's icon is a '?'

The `icon_AmericanEnglish.dat` is not to the spec that Nintendo likes in some way. This is usually caused by the format of the
image not being a JPEG, or it has EXIF data or an embedded color space.

I recommend stripping all EXIF metadata and saving without an Embed Color Space. You can do this quickly with ImageMagick,
`magick mogrify -format jpg -resize 256x256 -strip "C:\Users\John\Downloads\icon.png"`.

### The forwarder's icon is a loading circle, opening fails

This is a problematic issue and it isn't quiet clear why it happens, but there are steps to resolve it.

In this situation, leaving it partially installed and reinstalling does not seem to help, nor does deleting the NSP from
Data Management and then reinstalling. This seems to happen when there's some sort of software/data management corruption.
It may be caused when installing a Game or Software on an unsupported Firmware Version, then updating your Firmware and attempting
to reinstall a new Game or Software with the same Title ID. E.g., installing an NTON forwarder on 9.0.0 causing a corrupt
title, then updating to 12.0.0 bringing the corrupt installation with you, will continue to prevent that Title ID from working.

However, what helped me in this weird situation, is just deleting the software and then reinstalling with Goldleaf instead.
Goldleaf will warn you that it seems to be already installed (yet you deleted it via Data Management ?). Proceed to install
and overwrite anyway and it should then properly install and show the icon and launch without problems.

This weird sort of Software Installation database corruption seems to be somewhat common when using Tinfoil. I recommend using
Goldleaf for future Forwarder installations.

### The forwarder randomly stopped working after a while, I changed nothing!

You most likely updated your Switch's Firmware and need to update your sigpatches. If not, you may have deleted the NRO from
your Switch's microSD card or moved the NRO somewhere else. It cannot be moved as the built NSP loads the NRO at the specified
path when you ran `build`.

It's also possible the firmware update has broken the [forwarder ROM][ROM] that is used and needs to be fixed.
Firmware 9.0.0 and 12.0.0 are times the firmware has broken different forwarder ROMs in the past.
